File "table_gaussian_distribution_function.pdf" is produced from
"table_gaussian_distribution.tex" using pdflatex, as per the Makefile.
The diagram is made by "sourcing gaussian_diagram.R" in R, which
produces "gaussian_diagram.pdf"; the numbers come from
"gaussian_number_maker.R", which creates a data frame that is the
correct shape and is also correctly rounded to 4 decimal places.
